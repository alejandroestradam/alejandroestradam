# Hi there 👋

I am a biomedical engineer who found his field of interest in web development. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Nodejs, MongoDB, among other tools.

- 🔭 I am currently working on "BioDICOM viewer", a DICOM viewer capable of displaying and processing files in this format through bioimage processing.
- 🌱 I'm always constantly learning, so I'm currently studying advanced React topics, and I am getting started in Redux.
- 👯 I would love to collaborate in an innovative company that works with the most current technologies, and that is looking for new talent.
- 📫 If you think I can add value to your company, let's talk! Send me an email: inbi.alejandro@gmail.com
