# Hi there 👋

I am a biomedical engineer who found his field of interest in web development. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Nodejs, MongoDB, among other tools.

- 🔭 I am currently working on "BioDICOM viewer", a DICOM viewer capable of displaying and processing files in this format through bioimage processing.
- 🌱 I'm always constantly learning, so I'm currently studying advanced React topics, and I am getting started in Redux.

Below you will find some of my projects ⬇️
